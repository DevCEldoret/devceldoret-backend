## Issues

Check if the issue has been addressed or is in progress and if not , only then do you create a new issue. Remember to give it the appropriate [label](https://github.com/DevCEldoret/devceldoret-backend/labels)

## Enhancements
Describe the enhancement in mind and what you would expect to have resulted from this process. Submit the enhancement with the `enhancement` tag.

## Pull requests
Reference the issue or enhancement being referenced in the pull request and submit the pull request to the `development` branch.

## Workflow
We use the git workflow on our projects. If you are unfamiliar with the workflow, here is an awesome primer by [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). Basically, we have a `master` branch that serves for official release cycles, a `develop` branch that sums up features for the next release. Each `feature/chore/bug-fix` needs to be in its own branch originating from the  `develop` branch. When the develop branch has acquired enough features for a `release`, a temporary branch is created (intuitively named **release**) to mark the next release cycle. At this point, **No new** features will be allowed, just bug fixes or documentations. When we are confident enough and after extensive testing, the new branch is merged to the `master` with a version number, it is merged into the `develop` branch to get the fixes or modifications made on the `release` branch. After all that, the branch is deleted and we go on and start working on features for the next release (from the `develop` branch).
